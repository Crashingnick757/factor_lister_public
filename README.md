# factor_lister_public



To use the file, download all the files, extract them, edit the array in factor_lister.js so that it's got the numbers you want the factors of like this: \[number,number,number], open a powershell/command prompt/console/etc. in the directory with the js file, then run the command "node factor_lister.js", if you get an error that says something like: Cannot find module './factors/\<number>.json', then that means that there's not json file for that number, otherwise you should get an output with a list of the factors kinda like this:
  There are 2 numbers, and they are are 10,3
  Factors of 10 are 1,10,"\_".,2,5
  3 is a prime number
